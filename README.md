# Title: Bad Bank Website

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

## Description:
A portfolio project to create a website to display functionality, web design, React components, validation, and more. It was started in Module 18 (in the middle of the course), and built upon in the capstone project.

## How to Run on Your Own System:
- Git Clone
- NPM Install (everything should already be in the package.json file)
- Open terminal of choice into the folder and 'npm start'
- Open into designated port

The opened port should look like this:

<img src="/repository/README_Files/BadBank Home Page.png" alt="BadBank Home Page" title="BadBank Home Page">

## Technology Used:
- Visual Studio Code
- Terminal (Mac)
- Chrome Web Browser
- Dependencies installed:
    - bootstrap
    - http-server
    - react
    - react-bootstrap
    - react-jss
    - react-scripts

## Features:
- Beginning of authentication
- Ability to create a new user
- Increase and decrease the bank amount via Withdraw and Deposit pages
- View all data (unsecured)

## Roadmap/Features to Include:
- Refactor current code to implement knowledge learned in Module 27. 
- Implement more validation on create account page. Would also like to implement more validation overall for the entire website.
- Put the entire site on a database system so that information can be stored.
- Create a function where a user can delete their account from the database.
- Create a login page.
- Spruce up the home page some more.
- overall better CSS and design.
- Implement an "About this Site" page that is accessible from the navigation bar. For some reason, React Router is not registering the current links as a viable route.
